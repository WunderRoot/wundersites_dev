Project reference setup with ansible & vagrant
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Start by running:
	
	$ ./build.sh new

This will do the following:
	
	- Bring up & provision the virtual machine (if needed)
	- Build the drupal site under drupal/current

After finishing provisioning (first time is always slow) and building the site
you need to install the Drupal site in http://33.33.33.151:8080/install.php
(Note: on rare occasion php-fpm/varnish/e.g. requires to be restarted before
starting to work. You can do this by issuing the following command:

	$ vagrant  ssh -c "sudo service php-fpm restart"
	$ vagrant  ssh -c "sudo service varnish restart"

All Drupal related configurations are under drupal/conf

Drush is usable without ssh access with the drush.sh script e.g:

	$ ./drush.sh cc all

To open up ssh access to the virtual machine:

	$ vagrant ssh
